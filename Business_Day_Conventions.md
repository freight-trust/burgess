If the reset frequency is greater than the calculation period frequency then this implies that more than one reset date is established for each calculation period and some form of rate averaging is applicable. The specific averaging method of calculation is specified in FloatingRateCalculation. In case the reset frequency is of value T (term), the period is defined by the swap\swapStream\calculationPerioDates\effectiveDate and the swap\swapStream\calculationPerioDates\terminationDate.                                                                                                                  |swap/ swapStream/ resetDates/ resetFrequency                                                                           |                                                                                           |
